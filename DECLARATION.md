# TEMPEST DECLARATION OF FREEDOM

As the owner,copyright holder and developer of Tempest project, I hereby declare that Tempest project has been started and published to stop idiocity and effects of Dunning-Kruger while aiming to make world a better place.
<br>
## If you are looking for;
🔸 Some admins who cannot even tie their shoelace alone but act like they know everything with hidden support of others;
<br>🔸 Some admins who steal others work (even if once upon that others called as "friend") and publish them such as they did/could do it;
<br>🔸 Some admins who cannot reply user's technically questions and misdirect (usualy by teasing) them to wrong path to hide their incapability;
<br>🔸 Some admins who afraid/begrudge about other's success (even if once upon that others called as "friend") and try to stop/block them with stupid reasons/explanations;
<br>🔸 Briefly, idiocity, jeolousy, incapability, overestimation, arrogancy and ignorance;
<br><br>you are in very wrong place so my humble suggestion is for you to take a look the land of "tinyblackboxplus" and what you are looking for will **magically** appear after couple of seconds there.. 
<br><br>For all others; you are welcomed.. I guarantee you that there is no stolen good or stupid people here..
## Tempest License System
What!? Sorry, it is just copy-paste mistake. There is **no user licensing** or something like that. Tempest is completely free-to-use without any user license or subscription etc. and it always will be. You can also freely download and use shared preconfigured unlocked and/or locked siteconfig files.
<br>As in every free project, you may donate to support me and project so I can buy some super-critical increased corrosion resistance on elevated temperature materials to develop Tempest's fusion engine or just some coffee pods(some good ones are really expensive..)
## Tempest Donation System
This is the heart of the project. As I mentioned above, donations are not mandatory to use Tempest but with each donation;<br>
<br>🔹 You will be effected %0.0000001 less from planet's gravitational force (you can test it by yourself on your home scales)
<br>🔹 You will have a better calorie consumption rate
<br>🔹 In somewhere of the planet, 1 more kitten or puppy (based on your choice) will be owned by some unknown good guy
<br>🔹 And, this is what you were waiting for.. Wait for it.. Keep waiting.. Ta taaammm.. **Special Donator Badges**
## Special Donator Badge
I know you like this kind of badging system and most probably some of you already have similar badge from other places as below;<br>

<br>Unfortunately, I don't have such fancy donator badges but I collected very good ones for you. After donation, you can **automaticly** pick one of below and start using by setting it where you want to use (no need to wait for your badge anymore..). Here we go;<br><br>

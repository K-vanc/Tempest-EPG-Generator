# INTERNATIONAL DECLARATION OF TEMPEST

As the owner,copyright holder and developer of Tempest project, I hereby declare that Tempest project has been started and published to stop idiocity and effects of Dunning-Kruger while aiming to make world a better place.
<br><br>
## If you are looking for;
<br>ðŸ”¸ Some admin/project owners who cannot even tie their shoelace alone but act like they know everything with hidden support of others;
<br>ðŸ”¸ Some admin/project owners who steal others work (even if once upon that others called as "friend") and publish them such as they did it;
<br>ðŸ”¸ Some admin/project owners who cannot reply user's technically questions and misdirect (usualy by shouting or teasing) them to wrong path to hide their incapability;
<br>ðŸ”¸ Some admin/project owners who begrudge others success (even if once upon that others called as "friend") and try to stop/block them with stupid reasons/explanations;
<br>ðŸ”¸ Briefly, idiocity, jeolousy, incapability, arrogancy and ignorance;
<br><br>you are in very wrong place so my humble suggestion is for you to look land of "tinyblackboxplus" and what you are looking for will magically appear after couple of seconds there.. 
<br><br>For all others; you are welcomed.. I guarantee you that there is no stolen good or stupid people here..
## Tempest License System
What!? Sorry, it is just copy-paste mistake. There is **no user licensing** or something like that. Tempest is completely free-to-use without any user license or subscription etc. and it always will be.
<br>As in every free project, you may donate to support me and project so I can buy some super-critical increased corrosion resistance on elevated temperature materials to develop Tempest or just some coffee pods(some good ones are really expensive..)
## Tempest Donation System
This is the heart of the project. As I mentioned above, donations are not mandatory but for each donation;<br>
<br>ðŸ”¹ You will be effected %0.0000001 less from planet's gravitational force (you can test it by yourself on your home scales)
<br>ðŸ”¹ You will have a better calorie consumption rate
<br>ðŸ”¹ In somewhere of the planet, 1 more kitten or puppy (based on your choice) will be owned by some unknown good guy
<br>ðŸ”¹ And, this is what you were waiting for.. Wait for it.. Keep waiting.. Ta taaammm.. Special Donator Badge

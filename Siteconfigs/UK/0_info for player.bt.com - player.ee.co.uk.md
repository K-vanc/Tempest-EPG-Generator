After downloading and inserting the file to siteconfig folder,<br>
you can create your own channel list for 
* player.bt.com 
* player.ee.co.uk
<br><br>based on location code you want.<br>
All you need to do is, going into "Channel Generator" tab<br>
Choosing siteconfig file from loader<br>
And typing your location code into "User Key" box such as "GBR-ENG-north_west-liverpool" which is for "Liverpool" etc.<br>

<br>And all channels linked to entered location code will be listed in created channel.xml file<br>

<br>Note that if you run "Channel Generator" without any location code, default location code for London will be used and Tempest 
will auto create "bt_location_codes.txt" file into "/tempest_config/site_config/" folder for info

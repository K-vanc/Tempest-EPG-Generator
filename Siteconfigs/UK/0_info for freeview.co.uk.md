After downloading and inserting the file to siteconfig folder,<br>
you can create your own channel list for freeview.co.uk based on UK postal code you want.<br>
All you need to do is, going into "Channel Generator" tab<br>
Choosing siteconfig file from loader<br>
And typing your postal code into "User Key" box such as "L2 2DP" etc.<br>

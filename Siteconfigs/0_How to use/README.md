## HOW CAN I USE READY SITECONFIG FILES ?
Tempest will generate its file structure on the first run into the folder that "tempest.php" stored. <br>
You can download and copy/paste selected ready siteconfig files into the auto created; <br>
# **/tempest_config/siteconfig/**<br>
folder where is located near your "tempest.php" file.<br>
After that new siteconfig files will be displayed and available in Tempest siteconfig selectors
# It is highly recommended for UNIX users to recheck file ownership/permissions after copy/paste operations.
